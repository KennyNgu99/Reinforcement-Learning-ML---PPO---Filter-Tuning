# Reinforcement-Learning_(ML)_PPO_Microwave Filter-Tuning
Brief Description: _Apply Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to tune microwave filter automatically_.<br />

---


##**_About The Project_**<br />
- Manufactured RF filter will need to go through the filter tuning process to guarantee the performance without compromising
- There are many factors such as tedious / difficult manual tuning process and filter characteristics that harden the filter tuning process
- Machine learning approach is used to shorten the time taken of filter tuning process and boost the accuracy of tuning outcome
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) among reinforcement learning algorithm is chosen as its continuous action space and prominent divergence speed in continuous control tasks

Type of microwave filter used in this project:<br />
4th Order Chebyshev Filter
