# Reinforcement-Learning_(ML)_PPO_Microwave Filter-Tuning
Brief Description: Apply Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to tune microwave filter automatically.  


**_About The Project_**<br />
- Manufactured RF filter will need to go through the filter tuning process to guarantee the performance without compromising
- There are many factors such as tedious / difficult manual tuning process and filter characteristics that harden the filter tuning process
- Machine learning approach is used to shorten the time taken of filter tuning process and boost the tuning outcome
